    Project Description: 
    This program prompts and collects a user input username and password, and analyses
    the length of password, mixture of character types, password similarity to username 
    and presence of sequential alphabets and numbers in the password. The user is provided 
    with a strength score out of 100 and suggested solutions to improve password strength 
    in each of the 4 measured areas.
    
    Sample Dialogue(User enters username and password as 123):
